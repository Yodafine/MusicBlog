               Hi! I'm <strong>'Yodafine'</strong>, I'm 17 and this is the first website I've ever made! <br /> I created this website for my webdesign class, and my idea was to create a blog where I write music album reviews. <br /> 
               I hope that by making this blog I'll learn and better understand how to code, develop and design a good-looking website. <br/>
               I also hope that by writing reviews for this blog I can improve my writing skills, musical understanding, as well as help others discover new music(and maybe even connect with some music lovers!). 
            </p>
